The goal of `washr` is to provide tools to make the [openwashdata data
package](https://openwashdata.org/pages/gallery/data/) workflow
consistent and efficient.

## Installation

In the near future, we’re planning to release `washr` on CRAN. For now,
you can install the development version from
[GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("openwashdata-dev/washr")
```
