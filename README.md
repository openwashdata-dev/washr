The goal of washr is to provide tools to make [openwashdata data
package](https://openwashdata.org/pages/gallery/data/) workflow
consistent and efficient.

## Installation

Install the released version of `washr` from CRAN (to be submitted):

``` r
install.packages("washr")
```

Or you can install the development version of `washr` from GitHub with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("openwashdata-dev/washr")
```

## Usage

The prerequisite of using `washr` is an active R data package project.
The functions are mostly to set up package needed files to create,
document, and communicate the data package. The functions are
sequential. You need to interact with and modify the files generated by
the functions to successfully run next ones.

In a nutshell, a minimal workflow is the following:

``` r
library(washr)
library(devtools)


setup_rawdata()
# Work on data-raw/data_processing.R to clean the data, run the entire script
update_description()
# Work on DESCRIPTION to revise Title, Description and Authors manually
setup_dictionary()
setup_roxygen()
# Work on files inside R/ to revise generated roxygen comments
setup_readme()
# Work on README.Rmd to complete it
devtools:build_readme()
setup_website()
```
